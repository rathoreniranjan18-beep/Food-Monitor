# Food Edibility Monitor (IoT + Biosensors)

## Project Type
PBL-2 Mid Term Project (Simulation Based)

## Description
This project is an IoT-based smart food edibility monitoring system that detects whether food is edible, doubtful, or spoiled using biosensors.

Currently, this is a test-case simulation implemented in Wokwi to validate logic and IoT connectivity. Final hardware implementation using biosensors and Arduino will be completed in the next phase.

## Features
- Food spoilage detection logic
- Sensor-based monitoring (Gas, humidity, acidity)
- LCD output display
- IoT cloud monitoring using Blynk
- Wokwi simulation testing

## Technologies Used
- Arduino / ESP32
- IoT (Blynk Cloud)
- Biosensors (Gas, pH, humidity)
- Wokwi Simulator
- Embedded C

## Simulation Link (Wokwi)

## Future Work
- Real biosensor hardware implementation
- AI model training
- Mobile alert system
